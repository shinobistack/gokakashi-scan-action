## Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use this action in your workflow:

```yaml
name: Scan Docker Image

on: [push]

jobs:
  scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Scan Docker image
      uses: gokakashi/gokakashi-scan-action@v1
      with:
        api_host: 'https://api.gokakashi.com'
        api_token: ${{ secrets.GOKAKASHI_API_TOKEN }}
        image_name: 'myorg/myimage:latest'
        severity: 'HIGH,CRITICAL'
        fail_on_severity: 'CRITICAL'

    - name: Get the scan report URL
      run: echo "The scan report URL is ${{ steps.scan.outputs.report_url }}"
```

## Advanced Usage with Cloudflare Access

If your GoKakashi API is protected by Cloudflare Access, you can use the following configuration:

```yaml
- name: Scan Docker image (with Cloudflare Access)
  uses: gokakashi/gokakashi-scan-action@v1
  with:
    api_host: 'https://api.gokakashi.com'
    api_token: ${{ secrets.GOKAKASHI_API_TOKEN }}
    image_name: 'myorg/myimage:latest'
    severity: 'CRITICAL,HIGH,MEDIUM'
    publish: 'report_public'
    fail_on_severity: 'CRITICAL,HIGH'
    cf_access_client_id: ${{ secrets.CF_ACCESS_CLIENT_ID }}
    cf_access_client_secret: ${{ secrets.CF_ACCESS_CLIENT_SECRET }}
```
Refer [user.yaml](user.yaml)

## Security

Please ensure that you store sensitive information like API tokens and Cloudflare Access credentials as [GitHub Secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets).

## Error Handling

The action will fail if:
- The scan fails to complete within the expected time
- Vulnerabilities are found that match the `fail_on_severity` levels
